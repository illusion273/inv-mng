# Inventory-Managment-System
This is an application for managing sales, purchases and inventory based on AdventureWorks Database.<br>
Technologies used are C#, WinForms framework, ADO.NET, Microsoft SQL Server.<br>
It was developed in collaboration with two of my fellow students named Panagiotis Pappas and Ektoras Glynelis.
The last being the presenter of the corresponding [demonstration video](https://vimeo.com/586813864).<br>

To run the program just download [AdventureWorks2012](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms) sample database and restore in SSMS.
Then put your connection string in line 14 of ../Class/SQLConnection.cs.
